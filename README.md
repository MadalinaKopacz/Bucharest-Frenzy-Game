# Introduction to Game Development (2022-2023)

*Introduction to Game Development* is a course taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.
The course ends with a **gaming project** made by a team of 6 or 7 students, using **Unity**.

Our project is a level based platformer. The difficulty will increase progressively and at the end of the game it will be a boss fight.
During the game, the player can collect a currency that can be spent in a shop for different upgrades such as increasing the damage or the life bar.
